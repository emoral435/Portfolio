# With Great Power, Comes Great Gifts
>> My Experience With Leadership

## From The Start
Speaking about my experience in leadership starts nowhere better than when I first wanted to actively participate as a member in student organizations on my college campus (UIC, at the time). I, as many other students, wanted to join professional organizations that would help propel and jumpstart my career as a Software Engineer. I can speak for many others who were in my shoes that this anti-pattern goal of seeking organizations for the sole purpose of trying to *gain* led me to joining a **ton** of clubs and organizations at the start of my Freshman year. Naively, I believed this breadth of clubs that I had joined would not only look better on my resume, but that *more variety meant more depth*.

I could not be more wrong. I had no time to actually attend a majority of the events that each club had hosted, and I also was not able to actively give *back* to the organizations. While I do advise that upon first starting college to go to as MANY events as possible in order to find the clubs that they most resonate with, I do not think that it is sustainable, especially as classes get harder and start requiring more time. In my experience, I spread myself too thin, resulting in me feeling not quite connected with any organization.

## LOGICA
Moving forward to my second semester of college, while I was working in my schools computer science lounge, I randomly started talking to a few people that I had always seen around the lounge. Their faces were not unfamiliar; I had seen them helping out other students in office hours, I had seen them doing random side quests across campus, and I had also seen them stay late within the lounge, talking about anything and everything but computer science. During my conversation with them, the conversation whiplashed between topics, ranging from the classes that I was taking all the way to food and Latino dishes that I enjoyed. It all felt so natural.

During the conversation, I found out that they were part of [LOGICA](https://logica.students.uic.edu/), which served the Latino community at UIC who were studying computer science. I had heard about them before, but was far too shy and anxious when it came to attending their events. The thoughts that stopped me from going were along the lines of, "Well... I don't know anyone there, who would I be able to talk to if I went? I don't want to stand around awkwardly in the corner...".

Right when I was about to leave and head back home to continue doing more work, they casually mentioned that they wanted me to join the next year's board. I was stunned, quite frankly. Whether it was due to us bonding over the topics that where mentioned during the conversation, or because I was a Freshman and would help keep the organization not too senior-heavy, their proposition lingered in my head as the weeks followed. I attended some of their events, loving their Paleta Social event. It was an event were free ice cream popsicles were given out to LOGICA members on the main campus' fields. The joy that I felt connecting with other people from similar backgrounds alongside getting to know the names and faces of the folks who repeatedly came to the events gave me a sense of belonging within the community. It was awesome having a third space within campus that always held its door's open during any of LOGICA's events, alongside making bonds with members during the events that have lasted me up until this very day.

Sophomore year rolled around, and while I did not have much insight into the logistics and the work that went into running these events, I still wanted to join the executive members of LOGICA to help give back to the organization that had made itself home to me the previous semester. What was once a naive pursuite of breadth had turned into the simple pursuit of wanting to give back more to my community. I was selected to be the treasurer after interviewing with the president and vice president (Emily and Valeria 🫶), and was ecstatic to get to work. I focused all my energy into making fun events that our members would enjoy, and making sure that I learned everyones names by heart that went to our events. I was not *perfect* at remembering every name, but I was proud to be able to actively recall most people's name just upon seeing them. 

Eventually, before the school year ended, I had transitioned to be the treasurer for LOGICA. It felt like I had been entrusted something within the community that was securely held, and something that only someone who was trusted would be able to take it upon themselves.

## B[U]ILT
Now, some years have passed, and currently attend UIUC. I found myself in a similar situation as I did Freshman year, only now as a Junior... except this time, I knew the value of community and how good community support can be more valuable than just resume fluff. I actively looked for organizations with a similar feeling to LOGICA, and I was fortunate to find a student organization called [B[U]ILT](https://built-illinois.org/#/Home). I attended a social event and was welcomed warmly into a community of passionate computer science students who, whilst were all trying to pursue their dream jobs in tech, also wanted to have fun and spend hours away in the BUILT office talking about things unrelated to computer science. I decided myself this time to run to be the secretary for BUILT, knowing the responsibility that came with being an executive member more deeply this time, and was fortunate enough to have the community vote for me to be B[U]ILT's secretary.

## The Gifts I Have Felt
The role of being secretary for B[U]ILT has been nothing but wonderful for me. I have spent late nights within the office talking to our community members. I have seen a lot of our members grow professionally, all while thriving academically. On top of that, while not strictly professional, I have shared a few (many) drinks with them as well, being comfortable enough to show that side of me that not many truly get to see. Outside of that, being able to support an organization whose goal is to make others who where in similar shoes as me find a community is something that I deeply resonate with, and being able to visit pre-college schools to let the children in neighboring communities know that they will have a corner in college that will have their backs is something that I always wanted to do!

If I had to synthesize the best and biggest gifts that I have felt being the secretary of B[U]ILT, it would have to be the following...

* Learning how I best communicate with others in order to execute an event from start to finish - this has been *super* handy in getting things done quickly, fast, and conflict free! People will have different ideas, so learning how to best navigate verbally between these choices has been invaluable
* Hearing members say they enjoyed an event I had a hand in executing - probably a top ten most fulfilling thing to ever hear
* My time management skills improved substantially - taking from [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), having more responsibilities on top of being a college student required deep work in order to be able to juggle everything
* My task ranking skills naturally improved - during the ideation of events, the events scope would start to creep up into being almost impossible to execute (whether due to time constraints or budget constraints), so learning which aspects of the event would best suit fulfill the initial idea and bring the best "bang for your buck" for our members was invaluable
* Seeing new faces join our events, and eventually those new faces turned into recurring members and friends
* Building community - this is something that I know post college will be handy, as building community requires effort, and at times, some sacrifice

There has been no greater priviledge during college than to have been in these leadership positions. I have learned so much about myself, about how I should conduct myself with the given responsibility of a leadership role, and most importantly, I have had the great pleasure of meeting and befriending so many people within my community here during my time at college. The next post-college phase of life certainly holds a lot of ambiguity for me, but I know that the skills learned during my time at college will have prepared me well to find community. I owe a *lot* to my time during college, serving as a time-capsule that I can always look back upon it fondly.
