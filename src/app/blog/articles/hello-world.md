## About this blog
Now, why the heck would I even want to have my thoughts out into the public? That, indeed, is a very good question to ask! For the most part, this blog is moreso for my own vanity. I just NEED to show off my cats. And I also love the roboto mono font, and also... writing words that is not *code* related is useful, too. I probably should do that more.

I also get to expand my reach out to more people in order to either help, guide, or just share my thoughts regarding software engineering, life, or any other topic that I seem to find myself being hyperfixiated on. Who wouldn't want to help other people going on through the walk of life?

So... yeah. For now, there is not much else to add. I am writing this when I should be asleep. It's way to late for this. I have the sleep schedule of a grandpa. Logging off, pushing this off the branch where this is currently hosted.

Thank you for reading. **Goodbye, World!**
