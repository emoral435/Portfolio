# What Successful Software Engineers All Have In Common

## Disclaimer
Admittedly, I am still pretty green within my career. I mean, I am still not even a full time engineer at the time of writing this. To prevent myself from sounding pretentious, this blog post will aim beyond just the scope of myself. In order to achieve that, this blog post will:

1. Detail about the 5 most valuable traits that software engineers all share in common
2. Serve others who want to see what traits make a successful software engineer, perhaps even making them have self introspections into their engineering process'
3. Be a source of truth for myself to look upon during my own career progression

With that out of the way, lets discuss the most valuable software engineering traits

## Discussion
Throughout my many discussions with other engineers, all ranging from freshman starting out with Computer Science to senior engineers who have had decades of experience firefighting the most complex codebases possible, I have come to notice traits shared between the most successful engineers. Most would think that **strong** programming skills would be one of them, and while that is **indeed** valuable, there are other traits that get you farther than simply strong programming skills.

The top 5 most valuable traits, in no particular order, are:

* Being a feedback sponge
* Trying to provide more than they take
* Genuine love for problem solving and learning
* Good documentation skills
* Strong and positive communication skills
