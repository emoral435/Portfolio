## 🚨 COOL!
* This project was built with Github's GraphQL API that serves information regarding my public repositories. Instead of having to manually update my project section here every time,
this project automatically requests to get information on my 6 pinned repositories! Isn't that neat? Just me? Okay...
* This project also fully supports dark and light mode (to save your eyes of light mode...) and detects your system preferences to make the default mode reflect your system settings!
* Also mobile friendly 😀

## 🏃 HOW TO RUN 🏃
To run this project, you have two choices...
* To run this locally, you can run `npm run dev` within the root directory to spin up the project in dev mode on port 5173
* To run this build as shown on the website (the projects still won't load, as it is configured with Vercels hosted support for GraphQL calls right now only), run `npm run build` within the root directory

## AND FINALLY...
Thank you for checking out this repository :) Always looking to improving this, so if you have any feedback, make an issue and I will work on it! Perhaps it might even be the reason we go to the next semenatic versioning 👀
